        Growing up in Mumbai, India grandson to a family of refugees I felt a
        drive to explore, food, cultures, adventure and travel. I did well in
        studies and finished my Bsc. Biotechnology. When the question arose.
        What next? I never felt I would be stuck in a lab or work for a big
        pharma or join the Infosys. While studying industrial biotechnology I
        felt Wine could be my thing. I came to New Zealand in 2008 to study B.
        Wine Science in EIT. And boy was I in for a ride of my life. I could
        hardly stay in school and would be doing the odd jobs in vineyards and
        wineries all around Hawkes Bay. From sweeping sheds to contract vineyard
        work that was my life while studying. My wandering eyes, possibly hyper
        activeness and restless legs kept pushing me to my next vineyard or
        winery venture even if it was for a day or two.

        After working for several producers in Hawkes Bay for 10 years I met my
        wife Karena. I went to Oregon and explored the Willamette Valley wines.
        It was always the stories that made the wines so special. We decided we
        were going to dive deeper and let life and wine take us to our next
        adventure. We went to Clare Valley, Australia and fell in love with the
        Rieslings the Shiraz and the Cabernets! But it was the smaller producers
        that fascinated us. People who put in their valuable life and the
        all-important “time” into making small batch wines. We knew that no
        matter where we end up we will definitely be making our own wine
        someday.

        Time; Our past, Present and Future, pulled us back to New Zealand. Here
        in the Wairarapa a small vineyard in Masterton fell into our laps. Some
        things happen for a reason and perhaps this was the universe guiding us.
        So with no capital, overwhelming drive and passion, experience and
        skills. Like the MLTR song “I’ve got time… And nothing to lose.” We made
